# Matching Game

This is a simple web-based matching game where the user clicks on tiles 
with hidden images and tries to match up tiles with the same image.

# How to Play

After cloning or downloading the program, just open the `index.html` file in 
a browser. You will need to have JavaScript enabled to be able to play.

Select a grid size, either 4 tiles by 4 tiles, or 6 tiles by 6 tiles

Click on a blank gray tile. This causes the tile to be flipped over and the 
image revealed. The image will remain visible until you click on a different 
blank tile. If the images match, they will remain visible, otherwise both 
tiles will be flipped back over to the blank side. Use the Flip Speed 
Control buttons to control the length of time during which mismatched tiles 
are visible before being flipped back over. If the MEDIUM button is 
selected (the default), then 1 second passes between when the second tile 
is clicked and when both tiles are flipped back over. The SLOW button 
increases this time to 2 seconds, the the FAST button decreases it to 200 
milliseconds.

There are also buttons to start a new game (NEW GAME), 
restart the current game (RESTART), reveal all the tiles in the current 
game (SOLVE), and give a hint about where the match to the currently 
selected tile is (HINT). In order to get a hint, you need to have one tile 
already showing.
